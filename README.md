### Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup

Identifying design properties such as color palettes, typography, spacing, and component styles in a mockup design is essential because:

- It ensures visual consistency throughout the project.

- Helps developers accurately translate designs into code.

- Allows teams to maintain a unified design system.

- Improves collaboration between designers and developers.

- Reduces errors during implementation and streamlines revisions.

- Guarantees that the final UI reflects the intended user experience.

### Importance of a User-Friendly Design in a Booking System

A user-friendly design is critical for any booking platform because it:

- Minimizes friction in the booking process, improving conversion rates and improves customer satisfaction.

- Enhances trust by presenting clear and transparent information.

- Reduces user errors, especially during form submissions and payments.

- Improves navigation flow, ensuring users find what they need quickly.

- Leads to higher user satisfaction, retention, and repeat bookings.

## 4. Figma Design Specifications

The design mockups and prototypes are created in Figma, detailing layout grids, spacing, color tokens, and reusable components.
Each component will follow the Atomic Design Principle, ensuring scalability and reusability.

Key aspects include:

- Defined auto-layouts for responsive designs.
- Components built with variants (e.g., button states: default, hover, disabled).
- Accessibility-friendly contrasts and font scaling.

### Color Styles

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Primary** | #FF5A5F | Buttons, Highlights. |
| **Secondary** | #008489 | Links, Icons. |
| **Background** | #FFFFFF | Page Background. |
| **Text** | #222222 | Main Text. |
| **Secondary Text** | #717171 | Descriptive Text. |
|**Error/Alert** | #D93025 | Error messages or warnings.|

### Typography

| Element | Font | Weight | Size |
|----------|-------|--------|------|
| **Primary Font** | Circular | Medium (500) | 16px |
| **Headings** | Circular | Bold (700) | 24–32px |
| **Secondary Text** | Circular | Book (400) | 14px |
|**Buttons**|Circular|Semi-Bold (600)| 15px |
|**Captions**|Circular|Regular (400)|12px|

## 5. Database Design

### Key Entities

|Entity|Important Fields|Relationships|
|------|----------------|----------------|
|User|`id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`|Can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.|
|Property|`id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `location`, `price`, `description`|Belongs to a user (owner) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.|
|Booking|`id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`|Belongs to a property and a user.|
|Review|`id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`|Belongs to a user and a property.|
|Payment|`id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `method`, `status`, `timestamp`|Linked to a booking for payment verification|

### Relationships Overview

- A User can have many Properties.
- A Property can have many Bookings and Reviews.
- Each Booking is linked to one User, one Property, and one Payment.
- Payments ensure secure booking confirmation.

## 6. Feature Breakdown

|Feature|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|User Management|Handles user registration, authentication, and profiles. Supports secure login, logout, and password reset.|
|Property Management|Allows hosts to add, edit, or remove properties and manage availability.|
|Booking System|Enables users to search, select, and book properties. Handles date validation and prevents double booking.|
|Payment Processing|Integrates secure payment gateways for transactions and refunds.|
|Review System|Lets users leave ratings and comments after completed bookings.|
|Admin Dashboard|For platform administrators to manage listings, users, and disputes.|

## 7. API Security

### Key Security Measures

|Measure|Description|Importance|
|-------|-----------|----------|
|Authentication|Uses JWT or OAuth2 for secure user login and session management.|Protects access to user accounts and sensitive data.|
|Authorization|Role-based access control (admin, host, guest).|Ensures users can only perform allowed actions.|
|Rate Limiting|Restricts API request frequency.|Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks.|
|Data Encryption|Uses HTTPS and SSL/TLS.|Protects data in transit.|
|Input Validation|Sanitizes user inputs and payloads.|Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks.|
|Secure Payment Handling|Integrates trusted gateways (Stripe, Paystack, etc.)|Protects financial transactions.|

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
It automates testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring smooth and frequent updates without manual intervention.

### Why It’s Important

- Ensures faster development cycles.
- Detects and fixes bugs early.
- Improves deployment reliability.
- Enables collaborative workflows through automation.

### Tools Used

- GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment pipelines.
- Docker: Provides isolated, consistent environments for deployment.
- Docker Compose: Orchestrates multi-container applications.
- Nginx: Used as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
- PostgreSQL Service: Managed within Docker containers for integration testing.
